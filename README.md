**⭐Various WordPress Snippets⭐**

This repository is a collection of my WordPress snippets;
mostly of them are simple procedural PHP, often with CSS and JS outputted directly in the page;

In some cases, there is a more robust functions and classes, but it's not the common rule.

My basic stack is based on 
- WordPress
- Elementor Pro
- Hello Theme with child
- ACF Pro
- Dynamic Content for Elementor (https://dynamic.ooo) ⬅️This one rocks!

Based on the project, the stack may vary, and then other choices are made:
- Crocoblock complete suite (https://crocoblock.com) ⬅️Extremly powerful!
- Premium Addons for Elementor Pro (https://premiumaddons.com) ⬅️For special effects

Some snippets are plugin specific, but it's always pointed out in comments or directly in the snippet name 😉

Maybe one day all these snippets became a fully functional plugin 👻
